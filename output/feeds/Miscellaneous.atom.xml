Gnome going 3,
Ubuntu going Unity, people going nuts about that. I've been experimenting with all of them trying to
find the one that will serve me good and will evolve at a slower pace. I, being an exclusive computer/Linux user for a
long time, had tough time with the new UIs (I prefer the old style - 1 panel on the bottom, no wobbly-wobbly).
My distro of choice is Arch, and my DE of choice was Gnome + Openbox as a window manager. That combo proved
to be fast, usable, considerate to hardware yet elegant and (at this moment of time) old-school. I should disclose that
I use my primary desktop for everything, not just work (multimedia, internet, gaming) and as such, tilling WMs are a no-no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, Gnome turned 3 and everything changed. Openbox was no longer an option (it has issues even on fall-back mode) so I was
stuck with either metacity or mutter. At that moment I started looking into the alternatives. Spent some time on KDE,
got LXDE on my netbook (and tried it on my desktop), even tried XFCE for a couple of weeks. This is my subjective
view on why I stuck to Gnome 3 fall-back, what I hate about it, what I love and hate about KDE and why I can't work on KDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="testing-ground"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing Ground&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I start, I have to specify my testing ground. You might think that it's irrelevant, but I assure you,
hardware makes big difference. Also, graphic drivers matter too. So, my spec:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C2D E4600 2.8GHz (2.4 stock)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asus P5P43TD-Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8GB ddr3 ram&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVidia GT440 OC-ed with Nvidia blob (binary driver)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1x22&amp;quot;&amp;#64;1680x1050 + 1x24&amp;quot;&amp;#64;1920x1200 monitors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archlinux, latest updates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Arch is that you get almost vanilla versions of the DE in question. Kubuntu's KDE is tainted
with additions and configurations, and won't be fair to be judged like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kde"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;KDE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="center-align container"&gt;
&lt;img alt="../static/uploads/kde.png" src="../static/uploads/kde.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this beauty! KDE is my secret love. It's that good. It looks clean and good, it's the old way (one panel at bottom, desktop is working area),
it is feature packed and it evolves possibly the best of all of the DEs. And I would gladly use it! I will install it and not look
back right this moment, if it weren't for some annoying stuff that make me rage every time I work on KDE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dolphin"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dolphin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mouse back-button?! What's up with this! It's the 21st century. This has been implemented in almost every graphical file
explorer since '98. And yeah... I know about the xautomation and xbindkeys fix, but I want this implemented out of the box.
I really don't think it's hard to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kio"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;KIO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the KDE version of gvfs. NOT! It's not even implemented in every general-use software. My pain with this? If I want to
open a movie from a samba share with VLC, I have to wait for it to be temporarily downloaded to my PC and then watch it. On gnome,
I just open it, and watch it. The even funnier part is, if I use Kate in gnome, it automatically works with gvfs. Why don't you
just integrate gvfs or make KIO work similarly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="kde-wallet"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;KDE-Wallet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like to input password every time I do a &lt;em&gt;git pull/push&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sudo&lt;/em&gt; etc. The KDE-wallet handles ssh auth poorly.
There is a fix for it to work with ssh-agent, but why should I make fixes and patches when Gnome's keyring works out
of the box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="general-performance-bugs"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;General / Performance bugs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMO, my configuration is pretty decent to run the DE on full power. Well, apparently, KDE wants a dual-SLI 580GTX.
If I try to turn on the effects, KDE is unusable. If I turn them off, the interface shows random artifacts on screen.
And this doesn't happen just on NV hardware. ATI story is worse! Same with sandybridge graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, it happens, when I click on the start menu, the menu starts at the top of the screen. Or the panel is positioned on the
top half. When I try to reposition it, it slowly falls back to the original place. Happens every restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, KDE handles multiple monitors best of all DEs. I have to give credit for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, KDE is pretty decent DE. If they fix this few things, I will move back to it immediately and use it for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gnome-3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Gnome 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="center-align container"&gt;
&lt;img alt="../static/uploads/gnome.png" src="../static/uploads/gnome.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current setup. Fallback mode. Never really settled for shell. It's hard for a man working years and years under one desktop
model, to switch to something new. I'm fairly satisfied with Gnome3.2 fallback, but, i'm here to bash the things I don't like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="looks"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Looks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who thought that having a solid black bar for a panel was a good idea? Tint2 has better design out of the box. And, I was under
the impression that Gnome had some good designers in their team. Well, compare Faenza icons to default gnome ones, and Adwaita to
Zukitwo theme. You can do better than this Gnome. We care about the design too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="gnome-settings"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gnome settings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at KDE's settings manager. Now, back to yours. KDE is superior in this matter and you should learn from it.
I assume it's laziness that made you throw everything in a registry-like structure (gconf/dconf), but you could move some
important stuff in the settings manager. Now, if I want to change your mediocre theme for something better, I have to
install third party software for that. Or try to remember &lt;em&gt;Was it dconf or gconf?&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;Was it desktop/ or apps/&lt;/em&gt;. Seriously,
work on this. And don't even get me started on the screen-saver thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="plain-wrong-stuff"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Plain Wrong stuff&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutter in shell, metacity in fall-back. Did you stop to think that some people would want snap-to-edges in fall-back mode too?
Do you punish us, fall-back users, and stick us with metacity? Metacity has an awful compositor. Out of the box, when minimizing
the windows, you see this &lt;strong&gt;ugly&lt;/strong&gt; black border. So, the fix is, put metacity in low resources. How is rendering a full window
minimizing vs. rendering a black border use lower resources? If you, however, turn that on, you see a wireframe each time you drag
a window. So you gotta turn on some other thing (I can't remember which was it and I never can!). It's not documented properly,
and I have to google it every time I install a new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I assign a primary monitor, that means I want that monitor to be PRIMARY! Not the one on the LEFT! KDE handles this better.
Learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QT apps looked good in Gnome. Now, the look good, but they don't work good. Menus flying all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bundle-bash"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Bundle bash&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brasero sucks hard. K3b is much much better. If you don't trust me, I will show you my bag full of failed DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evince is good. But please... Bookmarks. A bit more functionality. You are trying to push Linux on a normal user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously... Theme manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shell"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Shell&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, my &amp;quot;favorite&amp;quot;. I gotta say this - it works better than Unity. Not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It handles dual monitor poorly. Each time I open window preview, If I have a window on the other monitor, it's also shown in a preview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications are far from noticeable - fallback mode handles notifications better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have Nautilus managing the desktop, you are in for headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, black bar?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I access Home folder without opening window preview?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant crashes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addons become incompatible fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ati blob issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrong crash management. Shell crashes, I don't want to restart GDM. Show me ANYTHING. Just let me hit save before restarting X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the worst part - Recent files in menu. When you open up the menu, If you don't &lt;em&gt;magically&lt;/em&gt; disable (there's a hack for this) recent files, shell becomes awfully slow. Give me a checkbox where I can disable them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;THEME MANAGER!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this said, Gnome has less impact on productivity, and I can live with these issues. But as soon as KDE fixes it's quirks, I'm moving to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, don't focus on the negative stuff I wrote above. It's subjective. Both DE's are good and both flawed. For me, there's a handful of issues that keep me from moving to KDE, and I really hope, they will be fixed soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I salute the community for making things like KDE and Gnome. They rock and they should be praised for that. But,
if we want Linux to be a choice of the normal (non-tech-savvy) user, you gotta get some things straight. Not everyone knows how
to configure using gconf/dconf, or configure xautomation/xbindkeys. Make it perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What ticks you about this Desktop Environments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. For the purists s/Linux/Gnu\/Linux/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It's the next big thing in linux graphic drivers world. At the moment, it drives the old (sub r300) ATI graphic cards
and it is in a very active development for NVidia and newer ATI(AMD) hardware. You can read more about Gallium &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/gallium"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last three weeks I became obsessed with the open source radeon driver. There is a lot of buzz going on there, a lot of optimizations and development (much expected in kernel 2.6.38) which is pretty much covered on the forums of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phoronix.com"&gt;Phoronix&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to take a spin on new drivers, the development versions of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mesa3d.org/"&gt;Mesa&lt;/a&gt; and a newer kernel 2.6.37 from the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/"&gt;Ubuntu mainline builds&lt;/a&gt;. I have an R700 based ATI HD4650. The gallium driver for this card is r600g. It shows many improvements and
optimizations but it's still in development cycle, unlike the driver for older cards r300g which is pretty much the default driver in Meerkat. Because of it's status, r600g is tricky to install
especially if you aren't comfortable with building git versions with compiler switches that enable gallium in mesa. But, thanks to the guys at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa"&gt;Xorg-edgers PPA&lt;/a&gt;
the simple mortals can have gallium on Ubuntu as easy as installing a video player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xorg-edgers PPA states that if you install the packages from the main PPA (ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa) and add Option &amp;quot;ForceGallium&amp;quot; &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; in xorg.conf, r600g will be used.
However, if this doesn't work with the latest updates, check &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/radeon"&gt;Xorg-edgers/radeon&lt;/a&gt;. Packages from this PPA enable gallium
by default. The only thing you need to do is add it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/radeon
sudo apt-get update &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sudo apt-get upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you installed the driver/gl stack from /radeon you should delete xorg.conf if you don't have any monitor specific lines there. If you used the main ppa, you should add that option &amp;quot;ForceGallium&amp;quot; inside the device section and &lt;em&gt;voila&lt;/em&gt;, you have r600g driver running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this with stock kernel 2.6.35 and updated 2.6.37 and it works pretty good. There is huge performance gain which I felt playing Penumbra Overture. On high settings, 1920x1200 resolution, the game is flying. Video is smooth, compiz works great and games play smoother.
The 2.6.38 kernel brings even more good news for radeon users. Massive performance gain with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=OTAwNA"&gt;PageFlipping&lt;/a&gt; and the CollorTilling implementations in the radeon driver give it a big boost.
We just have to wait for a more stable version of the kernel. The kernel is at rc2 stage at the moment of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Kudos to the open source driver developers, better make that to ALL open source developers involved in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

people having issues with installing the ATI drivers on Ubuntu, I
decided to put my thoughts and experience with it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experimented with the drivers quite a bit. I own Sapphire
Radeon HD 4650, and always try out games on Wine(i wish all of them
worked in Gnu/Linux) which is the reason I need updated drivers on my
rig. Two weeks ago, AMD(then ATI) updated the drivers to 10.8
version. By their claims, these drivers introduce some performance
gain, bugfixes and general stability. I installed the driver 30
minutes before writing this post and it actually works pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now for the technical part:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you need is a rig with AMD graphic card powered by a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://linuxmint.com/"&gt;Linux Mint&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntu.org/"&gt;Ubuntu Lucid distro&lt;/a&gt; with installed
build-essential. Driver (which
in fact is shell script) can be downloaded &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;. The script is called
ati-driver-installer-[version]-[CPU architecture].run. Download it to
new empty folder - lets call it ati in home folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have the driver and we can start with installation. Before we
actually commence the installation, we have to purge/remove the old
ati driver from the system. You should try these commands to remove
it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo apt-get purge fglrx
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo sh /usr/share/fglrx/fglrx-uninstall.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the removing is done, reboot the PC. You could be asked to turn
the graphics to low details (safe mode). Do that. Next, open a
terminal and navigate to the folder with the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/ati/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add permissions for execution to the script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;chmod +x ati-driver-installer-&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;version&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;CPU architecture&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.run
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate distro-specific packages(for lucid or mint 9):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./ati-driver-installer-&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;version&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;CPU architecture&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.run –buildpkg Ubuntu/lucid
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or list all available distro builds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo ./ati-driver-installer-&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;version&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;CPU architecture&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;.run –listpkg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this operation (if everything went ok) you will have several
.deb packages. Install them with the next command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo dpkg -i *.deb
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers are installed. If this is your first ATI driver
installation, invoke next command to make the initial config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;sudo aticonfig –initial
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reboot the PC, and you’ll have the drivers installed. If you have any
problems, refer to the Installation Instructions on the driver’s
download page.&lt;/p&gt;

proprietary ati drivers for linux practiced by the author. The author
