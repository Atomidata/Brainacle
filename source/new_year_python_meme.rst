Following Tarek Ziade's `#2012pythonmeme <http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/new-years-python-meme-2/>`_:

1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2011?
###########################################################################################

    - **gunicorn** - We are on our way to change every apache installation to gunicorn. Proved to be just as good and quite possibly, better.

    - **haystack** - I've built quite a few apps that employed solr, and every time I did that, I wrote the solr
      config and client API by hand. I was a bit skeptic about Haystack, but now that I've tried it in production,
      i won't be writing any more solr client APIs any more.

    - **python opencv** - Still haven't used it in production, but it's a very cool library.


2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2011 ?
#########################################################

Meta programming in Python. I worked on a project that relied heavily on meta 
programming. It helped me get more insight in django's models and magic.

3. What’s the name of the open source project you contributed the most in 2011 ? What did you do ?
##################################################################################################

Around late November and throughout December, I started contributing to `AskBot <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel>`_.
2011 was a very busy year for me, didn't have much time to contribute. I hope things will change to better next year.

4. What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011 ?
##################################################################

`/r/python <http://reddit.com/r/python/>`_. Every important news in the python 
community lands there pretty fast, and the discussions can be both
entertaining and educational.

5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012 ?
############################################################

    1. Qt / PyQT - IMHO Qt is the desktop toolkit that evolves the best of all. It has a great community,
    good documentation and a very rich feature set. It's cross-platform, and even mobile platforms (Android/iOS)
    are starting to support it.

    2. C - I slowly started brushing up my C skills during this month, and I want to learn more advanced topics in C next year.

    3. Pypy - Haven't had the time to test this bad boy better. I have played with it couple of times, but I want to
    make a serious effort and see the advantages it brings.

    4. If it's not too much already, I want to learn Scheme.

6. What are the top software, app or lib you wish someone would write in 2012 ?
###############################################################################

    1. Python based Redmine... Better python based redmine.
    2. Python based reporting software. Something like JasperReports
    3. Out of the context, but I wish i can switch to Python3. I wish more libs get ported
       since there are some very good features of py3 i want to exploit.

Want to do your own list? Here’s how:
